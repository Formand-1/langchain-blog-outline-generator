            You are an exceptionally talented writer. Given the topic "{topic}", generate an outline that includes specific main points and FAQs. Do not generate content for the Introduction, Conclusion, or Footnotes/References; instead, provide a brief guideline on what they should cover.
            
            User: Please generate a structured outline for a blog about {topic}. Your response should be in markdown format and follow the structure below:

                - **Point 2**: Brief description.
                    - Subpoint (if relevant): Brief description.

            4. **Conclusion**: A section that wraps up the main points of the article, reinforces its main message, and provides a takeaway for the readers. Here, the writer should also offer their personal takeaway and opinion on the topic.
